# Form Ggenerator v1.0

The Form Generator project is a very simple way to help programmers who need create HTML forms from their databe. Though this is a short project, I intend to provide script/stardadization improvements according to the time.

# How to use it?

All you need to do is follow these steps below:

* Open connection.php file and update it with your database informations
* Start the index.php and fill out the form with your table name and path information, which is the place where your form will be saved. Remember, if you do not choose a path, your form will be saved into formCreated folder as default.

# FeaturesFont fontawesome
This form uses:
* Font Awesome - Access https://fontawesome.com/icons/ for further informations how to use it properly.
* Bootstrap3

Feel free to use it and, if it's possible, let me know where and how you are using it!
